# GoMule-Reimagined

This is a fork of the popular Muling tool "GoMule" originally created by Andy Theuninck (Gohanman) and then continued by Randall and Silospen.
It was modified to be compatible with the Diablo 2 Resurrected mod "Reimagined" (2.1.1+)

## Restrictions & Known Bugs

The main feature of opening characters and shared stashes and moving items inbetween those and custom GoMule/ATMA stashes should be fully functional for D2RR.
You might encounter very few custom properties from D2RR that are not correctly rendered. This is just a visual glitch and there is no danger of file corruption or anything bad happening with those items or characters.
It's just a minor visual issue that I might try to fix if you find something like this and report it to me.

The Flavie Report feature is currently not compatible for D2RR and I currently have no plans of fixing this anytime soon or probably at all.
I have focused on the main feature which is muling.

At the time of the first release I have tested this version of GoMule on my own characters/stashes for about a week with no issues.
It's still advised to make regular backups of your characters and GoMule stashes - just in case.
